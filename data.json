This new fusion creates a unique blend of aggressive punk and haunting melodies by incorporating driving bass/synth lines, angular guitar riffs and innovative, solid drum beats. Topped off with sometimes sorrowful, but often psychotic vocals, Smoke Rings tightly grasps your full attention at live shows.  ",
