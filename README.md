# PDX Concert Guide
#### Find out about upcoming PDX area concerts

## Description
This is a Angular/Node/Firebase app displays PDX area concert listings. A Node script initially pulls event data from Songkick, artist info from Spotify, and band biographies from Last.fm, formats all of this into JSON data, and then stores it into Firebase. Angular then calls this info from Firebase and displays it with some formatting. 

## Setup
If you want to run a local copy:

`git clone https://github.com/tjohnst1/tjohnst1.github.io.git`

`cd pdx-concert-listings`

`npm install`   

`npm start`

Please note: This is still far from finished.
